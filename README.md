## Overview

This document presents an analysis of an LSTM model applied to stock price prediction. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them suitable for time series forecasting tasks such as stock price prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of historical stock price data for a specific company, obtained from a financial data provider such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. The dataset includes features such as opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and trading volume for each trading day.

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model architecture comprises multiple LSTM layers followed by a dense layer for prediction. The input to the LSTM layers is a sequence of historical stock prices, and the output is the predicted stock price for the next trading day. The model may also include additional layers such as dropout layers for regularization.

## Training Procedure

The LSTM model is trained using historical stock price data, typically using a sliding window approach where each input sequence consists of a fixed number of past trading days. The model is trained using gradient descent optimization algorithms such as Adam or RMSprop, and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function is commonly used to measure prediction accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated using various metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and others. These metrics quantify the difference between the predicted stock prices and the actual stock prices over a specified evaluation period.

## Results

The LSTM model demonstrates promising results in predicting stock prices, with low values for evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Visualizations, such as plots comparing predicted and actual stock prices over time, provide further insights into the model's performance and potential areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

The LSTM analysis highlights the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTMs, in predicting stock prices based on historical data. While the model shows promising results, there are challenges such as market volatility and non-linear relationships that may impact prediction accuracy. Further research and refinement of the model architecture and training procedures are needed to address these challenges and improve prediction performance.
